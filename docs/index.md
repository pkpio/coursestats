Course stats is humble tool to help students search and understand the grading stats of the courses offered at TU Darmstadt.

<br/><br/>
Course stats is currently only a web app available at <a href='http://coursestats.de'>coursestats.de</a>

<br/>
It also comes with an open API for those geeks out there willing to extend coursestats to other platforms.
